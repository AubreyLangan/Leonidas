                <h2>Birth</h2>
                <p>Leo was born on January 6th, 2024. The best birthday gift that I could ever give my husband.</p>

                <p>Leo spent his first night home on January 7th, 2024. He hated his bassinet at first. It was a rough first night home.</p>

                <h2>First Doctor's Appointment</h2>
                <p>Leo went to the doctor for the very first time on January 10th, 2024. He was 4 days old and HATED having to be stripped naked to be weighed and measured. He had lost almost a pound since leaving the hospital and his bilirubin levels were a little high.</p>

                <h2>First Hospital Stay</h2>
                <p>On January 11th, 2024, Leo had his first overnight stay at the Mary Bridge Children's Hospital. We went to the doctor's earlier that day to have his bilirubin levels checked again and found out that they were still too high. We spent the night at Mary Bridge where Leo spent most of our stay under the bilirubin lights. He wasn't a fan at first but eventually calmed down. What a trooper! He was 5 days old.</p>
