            <h2>Leo's Birth Story</h2>
            <p>On January 4th, 2024, my husband and I went in for my scheduled 38 week appointment. The doctor's office was very busy so we waited for about an hour past our scheduled time before we were called back. After getting called back, we waited for another forty-five minutes before we saw my OB-GYN. My OB-GYN measured my belly to check on baby only to find my belly was measuring big despite baby measuring small all pregnancy, we were sent back to the waiting room to wait to have an ultrasound done. At the ultrasound, fluid were looking good which is what my OB was worried about but baby wasn't moving around or making as many practice breaths as the tech would have liked. So, we got sent back upstairs to have a Non-Stress Test (NST) done. With the NST, baby started moving around and we learned I was starting to have contractions! After awhile, we were sent to the Labor and Delivery (L&D) department of our local hospital for further tests to be run.</p>
            <p>With a quick stop back home first, my husband fed our dogs and took them out to go potty while I finished packing my hospital bag. We were so excited to think that we could potentially meeting our sweet baby that night! Off to L&D we went where they hooked me up to the monitors so they could check on baby much like they did at the doctors office. We waited for about three hours before we saw the on-call doctor. By the time we met the doctor, she had been talking with my OB about starting the induction process! She said that baby was doing well but and I quote, "There's no reason to keep you pregnant." I immediately agreed with wanting to start the induction process - I was very much over being pregnant at that point despite it being an overall easy pregnancy. </p>
            <p>It was around midnight that night after we got settled in our labor room and had dinner, that we started the induction process with the first round of Cytotec. I had gone in to L&D at only a centimeter dialated and after many hours and six rounds of Cytotec, I was still only a centimeter dialated. We then moved onto Pitocin and I had a balloon inserted to further help my cervix prepare to go into labor. I cried after the balloon was placed, it hurt so bad. I puked from the pain amidst tears. They gave me pain medication to help and I started having back contractions. Things were really starting to ramp up now! It was maybe a few hours later, when the nurse checked my cervix that my water broke and I was four centimeters dialted. The balloon had done it's job and came out easily. Time flew by as I continued to dialate and get ready to have our baby. By now it was Saturday, January 6th, 2024, my husband went to go check on the dogs as he had been doing every so often during our stay. It was during this last check in that it just about time to push. I held on as best as I could while I called him frantic to hurry back - it was baby time!</p>
            <p>He hurried back as fast as he could, with our nurse and one of the midwives that was on call that weekend, we started pushing. My husband held my hand and gave me water. Everyone was so encouraging and after two or three hours of pushing, my sweet baby was born!</p>
            <p>Leonidas Gabriel Langan was born at 5:37 pm on January 6th, 2024 at exactly 39 weeks gestation. He was born weighing 7 pounds 7 ounces and 21 inches long. My sweet boy, who all pregnancy were told was going to be small, was just really tall! My little string bean. We were discharged the next night, baby and I doing great just exhausted. </p>

            <h2>Leo at One Month Old</h2>
            <p>Leo turned one month old on February 6th, 2024. At one month, Leo had finally surpassed his birth weight! He had officially grown out of newborn clothes and diapers and into 0-3 months clothes and size 1 diapers. He also got to have his first bunch of visitors. He got to meet his grandparents (my parents), his Aunt Alli (my youngest sister), my dad's parents, his Uncle Jeremy (my brother) and his Great Aunt Michelle (my dad's sister). It was so nice to have so much family around. Leo's world is starting to exand slowly at one month old. Leo went to his first two restaurants (Applebees and Sharis). He slept through most of both meals. Leo celebrated his first Valentine's Day by getting to go bowling with Mommy and Daddy. He also had his first ever babysitter! His G watched for a couple of hours so that Mommy and Daddy could go get Mommy a new phone.</p>

            <p>Leo turned two months old on March 6th, 2024. At two months old, Leo's world has been slowly expanding more. We're taking short trips to different stores to get out of the house. This month Leo got to celebrate St. Patrick's Day by meeting his godparents. This month, Leo has started to roll both from his back to his tummy and from his tummy to his back. Leo celebrated his first Easter with a cute bunny outfit to wear and a basket filled with some goodies.</p>

            <h2>Leo at Three Months Old</h2>
            <p>Leo turned three months on April 6th, 2024. At three months old, Leo is now in size two diapers and 3-6 month clothes. My little string bean is growing so fast! At three months old, Leo got to help Mommy celebrate her birthday with a nice dinner out and cake. Leo was very curious about the candles on the cake. At three months, Leo and I have started exploring more of the world together. We visited the library for the first time for Baby Story Hour. Leo had a pretty good time, although he mostly just people watched. We also started going to workout classes with Fit4Mom. Leo is still adjusting to being in the stroller for longer periods. Most of the time, I end up wearing Leo to finish the workout.</p>

            <h2>Leo at Four Months Old</h2>
            <p>Leo turned four months on May 6th, 2024. At four months, Leo has started teething with at least one tooth trying to poke through. However, no teeth have popped up just yet. He still sleeps really good at night sometimes falling asleep as early as 7:50 pm. Naps on the other hand don't come as easily. If we're out and about in the morning, Leo will sometimes take a morning nap but he doesn't usually take them if we're at home. His earliest nap seems to be around 1 to 2 pm. Sometimes there's another nap between that one and him going to bed for the night but not always.</p>
